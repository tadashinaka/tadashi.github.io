            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Disasters are complex socioecological phenomena that emerge at the intersection of hazard agents and human social systems. They represent human—more-than-human interdependencies where physical events (e.g., earthquakes, cyclones, floods, droughts) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., industrial pollutants, toxic waste, contamination events) interact with vulnerability produced through historical socioeconomic processes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Disasters are not merely external events that impact society, but rather expressions of unequal development trajectories, asymmetric power relations, and socially differentiated patterns of risk. From a world-ecology perspective, disasters are simultaneously producers and products of worldmaking processes—revealing how historical and ongoing political-economic structures shape human-nature relations across multiple scales, from the local to the regional and global, fundamentally affecting community well-being through disrupted value systems and regional ecological relationships that undermine sustainable co-existence.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6 text-blue-700 border-b-2 border-blue-200 pb-2">Operationalize It</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Applying our disaster research approach involves examining how disaster events and processes have historically shaped and been shaped by regional connectivity in East Asia. Just as World Ecology provides analytical focus on how capital, power, and resources/materials interlink to produce uneven impacts, disaster analysis reveals how these same forces create differentiated vulnerabilities to hazards. This approach helps us understand disasters not as temporary disruptions to “normal” development (building roads, factories, tourism, etc.), but as constitutive elements of world-making that manifest the contradictions within prevailing socio-economic systems.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Disasters function as boundary concepts connecting our research across scales (regional, national, local) and governance domains (economic, environmental, disaster). By viewing disasters as co-produced through natural processes and social structures, we decenter purely technocratic or naturalist accounts of disaster causation. Instead, we recognize disasters as relational phenomena embedded within broader systems that commodify and reorganize elements of nature. This perspective allows us to trace how disaster governance both reflects and reinforces existing political-economic structures, while identifying opportunities for transformation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                By examining historical and contemporary disasters through this lens, we can better understand the mutually constitutive relations between regional economic development, environmental change, and disaster risk. This enables us to move beyond siloed approaches to policy and governance, toward holistic frameworks that place ethical principles of justice and reciprocity at the center of social-ecological interactions.

                Drawing on our disaster research approach (Forensic Investigation of Disaster (FORIN) with Development-Environment-Disaster (D-E-D) cycle model), each disaster case is as an empirical window onto the interlocking processes whereby economic expansion reshapes ecological systems and, in turn, re-materializes as risk. The project refines the model through extensive and intensive dialogue with colleagues working on regionalism, values, and community well-being within the broader World-Ecology Framework, ensuring that the analytical lens integrates trans-boundary political-economy, ethical commitments, and community-centered resilience.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed my-6">
                Typhoon Isewan 1959 triggered Japan’s Basic Act and later fed into Asia-Pacific regional DRR norms, illustrating how altered development values and nascent regionalism can raise community well-being by institutionalizing risk governance. The 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami sparked a new regionalism, seen in the creation of the IOTWMS and the AADMER. Guided by shared values of equity and ecosystem care, this cooperation puts community well‑being at the heart of post‑tsunami development, showing how value‑based regional action can break the cycle of disaster risk. During the Chao Phraya Flood of 2011, export-oriented land-use choices intensified hazard effects, while cascading supply-chain losses spurred regional BCP initiatives (APEC/ASEAN-partner programmes) on business-continuity, underscoring that balanced development values and livelihood-focused well-being represent cornerstones of regional resilience. The Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami of 2011 demonstrated how reliance on hard defenses combined with demographic shifts heightened mortality, yet culturally rooted recovery efforts, including pine-tree symbolism and festival revival, showcased community well-being as a resilience metric that now informs trans-Pacific regionalism and value-rich, inclusive risk governance.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Together these four cases demonstrate how research findings—enriched by World-Ecology’s attention to trans-scalar flows of capital, labour and nature—helps decode the structural roots of vulnerability while elevating regional values and community well-being as critical levers for transformative disaster governance.
